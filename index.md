# Introduction

StatusBox is a service that helps you easily setup monitoring stack for scheduled tasks:
- video transcoding
- data processors
- workers from task queues
- database backups
- reports generators
- ETL tasks
- SSL renewal
- and many more!

We collect **tasks execution history** and **logs** per each job for futher analysis and **send you notifications** if something goes wrong (like failed job, not started cron job or in case of some error occured).

We provide simple to use and integrate REST API and web-based dashboard.

<hr />

The project is in beta test and therefore there are no paid plans so far.

*You can have up to **70 job checks per month** with up to **150 max events per job for free** and we'll keep you **jobs execution history for 60 days.*** 

If you like our tools and want to extend those limits, please reach us at email: `statusboxhq@gmail.com`.
